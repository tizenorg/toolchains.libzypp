  (#175188, CVE-2006-2414)</changelog>
<changelog author="- mrueckert@suse.de" date="1139832000">- added dovecot-1.0.beta3_indexfixes.patch
  * added index sync fixes
  * added fix for ldap urls
  * let dovecot not send header for mails we didnt announce with
  EXISTS
  * allow empty protocol line so you can use dovecot for pipe only
- removed dovecot-1.0.beta2-sqlite_signedness.patch
  applied upstream
- replaced all occurences of /usr/libexec with %{_libdir}</changelog>
<changelog author="- mrueckert@suse.de" date="1139400000">- update to version 1.0.beta3
  * Dotlock code changed to timeout faster in some situations when
  the lock file is old.
  + Added support for loading SQL drivers dynamically (see INSTALL file
  for how to build them)
  + Keywords are stored to dboxes, and other dbox improvements.
  + dict-sql could actually work now, making quota-in-sql-database
  possibly working now (not fully tested)
  + Added mail storage conversion plugin to convert automatically from
  one mailbox format to another while user logs in. Doesn't preserve
  UIDVALIDITY/UIDs though.
  + Added plugin { .. } section to dovecot.conf for passing parameters
  to plugins (see dovecot-example.conf).
  + Added ssl-build-param binary which is used to generate
  ssl-parameters.dat. Main dovecot binary doesn't anymore link to
  SSL libraries, and this also makes the process title be clearer
  about why the process is eating all the CPU.
  o Fix building without OpenSSL
  o Fixed memory leak in MySQL driver
  o Fixes to checkpassword
  o Broken Content-Length header could have broken mbox opening
  o Fixed potential hangs after APPEND command
  o Fixed potential crashes in dovecot-auth and imap/pop3-login
  o zlib plugin now links with -lz so it could actually work
  o kqueue fixes by Vaclav Haisman
- update dovecot-lda with latest fixes to compile against b3</changelog>

<changelog author="- mrueckert@suse.de" date="1138017600">- update to 1.0.beta2. this is a bugfix release.
  + Added SQLite support. Patch by Jakob Hirsch.
  + Added auth_debug_passwords setting. If it's not enabled,
  hide all password strings from logs.
  + Added mail_cache_min_mail_count and mbox_min_index_size
  settings which can be used to make Dovecot do less disk writes
  in small mailboxes where they don't benefit that much.
  + Added --build-ssl-parameters parameter to dovecot binary
- SSL parameters were being regenerated every 10 minutes,
  although not with all systems.
- Fixed dovecot-auth crashing at startup. Happened only with some
  specific compilers.
- base_dir was supposed to be set world-readable,
  not world-writable
- disabled epoll for now.
  Jakob Hirsch is working on a patch for this.
- sqlite3 support enabled
  + dovecot-1.0.beta2-sqlite_signedness.patch
  fix a signedness warning
- apply fix for dovecot-lda that allows using default_mail_env
- includes dovecot-lda changelog</changelog>

<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1108382400">- Update to 0.99.14 including:
  o Message address fields are now parsed differently, fixing some
  issues with spaces. Affects only clients which use FETCH ENVELOPE
  command.
  o Message MIME parser was somewhat broken with missing MIME boundaries
  o mbox: Don't allow X-UID headers in mails to override the UIDs we
  would otherwise set. Too large values can break some clients and
  cause other trouble.
  o passwd-file userdb wasn't working
  o PAM crashed with 64bit systems
  o non-SSL inetd startup wasn't working
  o If UID FETCH notices and skips an expunged message, don't return

<changelog author="- mls@suse.de" date="1138190400">- converted neededforbuild to BuildRequires</changelog>
<changelog author="- mrueckert@suse.de" date="1138017600">- update to 1.0.beta2. this is a bugfix release.
  + Added SQLite support. Patch by Jakob Hirsch.
  + Added auth_debug_passwords setting. If it's not enabled,
  hide all password strings from logs.
  + Added mail_cache_min_mail_count and mbox_min_index_size
  settings which can be used to make Dovecot do less disk writes
  in small mailboxes where they don't benefit that much.
  + Added --build-ssl-parameters parameter to dovecot binary
- SSL parameters were being regenerated every 10 minutes,
  although not with all systems.
- Fixed dovecot-auth crashing at startup. Happened only with some
  specific compilers.
- base_dir was supposed to be set world-readable,
  not world-writable
- disabled epoll for now.
  Jakob Hirsch is working on a patch for this.
- sqlite3 support enabled
  + dovecot-1.0.beta2-sqlite_signedness.patch
  fix a signedness warning
- apply fix for dovecot-lda that allows using default_mail_env
- includes dovecot-lda changelog</changelog>
<changelog author="- mrueckert@suse.de" date="1137758400">- added dovecot-1.0.beta1_sslparam-regeneration.patch
  fix timer for regeneration of ssl params</changelog>
<changelog author="- mrueckert@suse.de" date="1137499200">- added dovecot-1.0beta1_pie.patch
- compile with -fstack-protector</changelog>
<changelog author="- mrueckert@suse.de" date="1137499200">- Update to version package for 1.0.beta1
  this is a complete rewrite see
  /usr/share/doc/packages/dovecot/ChangeLog.gz for all changes
- added dovecot-cvs_inotify.patch
  fixes a small include for inotify support</changelog>
<changelog author="- ro@suse.de" date="1127736000">- added LDAP_DEPRECATED to CFLAGS</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1117800000">- Compile with -fpie/-pie</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1108382400">- Update to 0.99.14 including:
  o Message address fields are now parsed differently, fixing some
  issues with spaces. Affects only clients which use FETCH ENVELOPE
  command.
  o Message MIME parser was somewhat broken with missing MIME boundaries
  o mbox: Don't allow X-UID headers in mails to override the UIDs we
  would otherwise set. Too large values can break some clients and
  cause other trouble.
  o passwd-file userdb wasn't working
  o PAM crashed with 64bit systems
  o non-SSL inetd startup wasn't working
  o If UID FETCH notices and skips an expunged message, don't return
  a NO reply. It's not needed and only makes clients give error
  messages.</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1106481600">- Update to 0.99.13 including:
  o GNUTLS support hasn't been working for a while, so it's not even
  tried to be used anymore unless explicitly wanted.
  o Added CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanism.
  o Added SMD5 and LDAP-MD5 password schemes and changed MD5
  scheme to use LDAP-MD5 if the password isn't in MD5crypt format.
  o Workaround for some POP3 client bugs: if message doesn't
  contain the &quot;end of headers&quot; empty line, add it automatically.
  o vpopmail supports now all password schemes, most importantly
  MD5crypt works now without support from libc's crypt()
  o SQL and LDAP authentication was broken
  o SEARCH UNKEYWORD wasn't working</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1102420800">- Update to 0.99.12.1 including:
  o Fix memory leaks in LDAP, MySQL and PGSQL userdb/passdb
  o Fix hanging when parsing mails that have over 4096 bytes in one
  line (SMTP servers normally don't allow over 1000 bytes so it
  shouldn't be much of a problem)
  o FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE sometimes gave a wrong reply
  (eg. with FETCH (BODYSTRUCTURE RFC822.SIZE) if it wasn't cached)
  o Never return more than one INBOX in LIST even if there are such
  files. They don't work anyway and it just confuses clients.
  o mbox: Don't allow creating INBOX directory by creating/renaming
  mailboxes under it. They just wouldn't work.
  o POP3: Don't return PLAIN in SASL list. We don't support initial SASL
  responses, so it only breaks with most clients that try to use it.
  o IMAP and POP3 login processes may have sent each line in two IP
  packets, one with the data and another with CR+LF. Some clients
  didn't work because of this.</changelog>
<changelog author="- kukuk@suse.de" date="1100520000">- Use common-* PAM config files</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1098532800">- Switch heimdal-* to kerberos-devel-packages in #nfb as pr. requst
  of Mr. Carsten Höger</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1094299200">- Update to dovecot-0.99.11 which mainly is a bugfix release with:
  o 127.* and ::1 IP addresses are treated as secured with
  disable_plaintext_auth = yes
  o auth_debug setting for extra authentication debugging
  o Some documentation and error message updates
  o Create PID file in /var/run/dovecot/master.pid
  o home setting is now optional in static userdb
  o Added mail setting to static userdb
  o After APPENDing to selected mailbox Dovecot didn't always notice the
  new mail immediately which broke some clients
  o THREAD and SORT commands crashed with some mails
  o If APPENDed mail ended with CR character, Dovecot aborted the saving
  o Output streams sometimes sent data duplicated and lost part of it.
  This could have caused various strange problems, but looks like in
  practise it rarely caused real problems.</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1093953600">- Don't create unused directories [#44362]</changelog>
<changelog author="- mmj@suse.de" date="1092052800">- Update to dovecot-0.99.10.9 with the following item since .6:
  o MySQL compiling got broken in last release
  o More PostgreSQL reconnection fixing
  o LDAP support compiles now with Solaris LDAP library
  o IMAP BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE replies were wrong for MIME parts which
  didn't contain Content-Type header.
  o MySQL and PostgreSQL auth didn't reconnect if connection was lost
  to SQL server
  o Linking fixes for dovecot-auth with some systems
  o Last fix for disconnecting client when downloading mail longer than
  30 seconds actually made it never disconnect client. Now it works
  properly: disconnect when client hasn't read _any_ data for 30
  seconds.
  o Added outlook-pop3-no-nuls workaround to fix Outlook hang in
  mails with NULs.
  o Config file lines can now contain quoted strings (&quot;value &quot;)
  o If client didn't finish downloading a single mail in 30 seconds,
  Dovecot closed the connection. This was supposed to work so that
  if client hasn't read data at all in 30 seconds, it's disconnected.
  o Maildir: LIST now doesn't skip symlinks</changelog>

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

- Potential buffer overflows in minires repaired.
- A correction of boolean parsing syntax validation - some illegal syntaxes
  that worked before are now detected and produce errs, some legal syntaxes
  that errored before will now work properly.
- Some search-and-replace errors that caused some options to change their
  names was repaired.
- Shu-min Chang of the Intel corporation has contributed a perl script and
  module that converts the MS NT4 DHCP configuration to a ISC DHCP3
  configuration file.
- Applied the remainder of the dhcpctl memory leak patch provided by Bill
  Squier at ReefEdge, Inc.  (groo@reefedge.com).
- Missing non-optional failover peer configurations will now result in a soft
  error rather than a null dereference.
- use BSD sockets instead of LPF (makes iptables filtering of
  packages possible for server and relay. It doesn't work on the
  client, though, so that one requires seperate compilation.) See

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1091707200">- update to 3.0.1
  * The global variable 'cur_time' was centralized and is now
  uniformly of a type #defined in system-dependent headers. It
  had previously been defined in one of many places as a 32-bit
  value, and this causes mayhem on 64-bit big endian systems. It
  probably wasn't too healthy on little endian systems either.
  * A printf format string error introduced in rc14 was repaired.
  * AIX system-dependent header file was altered to only define
  NO_SNPRINTF if the condition used to #ifdef in vsnprintf in
  AIX' header files is false.
  * The Alpha/OSF system-dependent header file was altered to
  define NO_SNPRINTF on OS revisions older than 4.0G.
  * omapip/test.c had string.h added to its includes.

  subdirectory the chroot jail is now owned by root. [#40174]  Use
  mkstemp to create temporary files. [#40267]
- don't use startproc to start dhcpd, because startproc waits a
  fixed time (100 msec) until it decides whether the service is
  running or not. Now that dhcpd might have to contact an LDAP
  server first to read its configuration, starting up can take
  longer than that, and the init script would falsely report
  &quot;success&quot; even when the server cannot start up due to broken
  configuration or non-existant interfaces. Increasing the
  startproc timeout (-t) is not a real alternative because, because
  it would imply a fixed dely to the init script, and it might
  still be too short.  [#40350]</changelog>

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1091707200">- update to 3.0.1
  * The global variable 'cur_time' was centralized and is now
  uniformly of a type #defined in system-dependent headers. It
  had previously been defined in one of many places as a 32-bit
  value, and this causes mayhem on 64-bit big endian systems. It
  probably wasn't too healthy on little endian systems either.
  * A printf format string error introduced in rc14 was repaired.
  * AIX system-dependent header file was altered to only define
  NO_SNPRINTF if the condition used to #ifdef in vsnprintf in
  AIX' header files is false.
  * The Alpha/OSF system-dependent header file was altered to
  define NO_SNPRINTF on OS revisions older than 4.0G.
  * omapip/test.c had string.h added to its includes.
- drop obsolete dhcp-curtimetype.patch
- cope with missing files during chroot setup (e.g., if no
  resolv.conf exists) [#40728]
- remove duplicated option &quot;-cf&quot; from usage output
- add notes about the used raw socket API to README</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1089979200">- update to 3.0.1rc14

- dhcpsync: use try-restart (so the server isn't started if it has
  been stopped)
- remove notify messages that are sent to root
- check if dhcpd was active at boot time before update and
  restore runlevel links if needed [#41215], and PreRequires for

  user id for the server, and move the leases database into a
  subdirectory (/var/lib/dhcp/db). With the exception of that
  subdirectory the chroot jail is now owned by root. [#40174]  Use
  mkstemp to create temporary files. [#40267]
- don't use startproc to start dhcpd, because startproc waits a
  fixed time (100 msec) until it decides whether the service is
  running or not. Now that dhcpd might have to contact an LDAP
  server first to read its configuration, starting up can take
  longer than that, and the init script would falsely report
  &quot;success&quot; even when the server cannot start up due to broken
  configuration or non-existant interfaces. Increasing the
  startproc timeout (-t) is not a real alternative because, because
  it would imply a fixed dely to the init script, and it might
  still be too short.  [#40350]</changelog>

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

  fixed time (100 msec) until it decides whether the service is
  running or not. Now that dhcpd might have to contact an LDAP
  server first to read its configuration, starting up can take
  longer than that, and the init script would falsely report
  &quot;success&quot; even when the server cannot start up due to broken
  configuration or non-existant interfaces. Increasing the
  startproc timeout (-t) is not a real alternative because, because
  it would imply a fixed dely to the init script, and it might
  still be too short.  [#40350]</changelog>

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1112961600">- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
  peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
  The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
  primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
  the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
  This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
  when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
  lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
  Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
  properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
  to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
  to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
  alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
  Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
  Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
  a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
  retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
  15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
  single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
  a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
  responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
  meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
  The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
  condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
  network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
  a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
  persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes (&quot;set var = value;&quot;) are now removed from leases allocated
  by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
  number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
  7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
  cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
  at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
  or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
  should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
  token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
  causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
  no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
  to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).

<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1102420800">- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
  initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
  were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
  option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
  (&quot;Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.&quot;).  The
  implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
  so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
  initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
  discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
  (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch</changelog>
<changelog author="- poeml@suse.de" date="1101816000">- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
  try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
  where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
  not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
  name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
  repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
  system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
  incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
  previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
  a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
  about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
  would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
  the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
  Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
  thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
  once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
  specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
  by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
  incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
  implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
  sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
  was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
  respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
  build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
  easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * &quot;allow known-clients;&quot; is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
  peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
  lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
  executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
  the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
  cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
  Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
  to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
-Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
  is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
  of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
  DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
  to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
  ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
  underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
  them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
  re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
  to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
  by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
  ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
  Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
  to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
  clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
  wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
  that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
  fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
  to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
  tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
  would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
  server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
  Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.
